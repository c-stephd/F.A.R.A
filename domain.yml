      1. Before approaching the patient look and listen for any signs of danger. Once you have carefully checked to make sure that the area is safe, you can approach the patient and check for a response. Make sure that you do not become a patient too, you are no help to the patient if you become injured yourself. 
      2. Start by identifying seriously injured persons, such as, patients that are bleeding from head, nose, legs, and other organs. In general, victims that can talk or scream are in a better condition than those who cannot breathe or scream. 
      3. Check for consciousness of patients. Check the pulse to see whether the person is breathing. Keep talking to the person to keep him conscious until medical help arrives. You can ask questions, such as a name or squeeze shoulders of the patient If the does not reply, he is in an unconscious state.
      4.	If you cannot make an area safe, call 112 for emergency help before performing first aid. Stand clear until the emergency services have secured the scene.

      To handle emergency;
      1.	Ensure that the area is safe for you, the bystanders and the patient
      2.	Check for response from the patient; ask for a name or squeeze shoulders of the patient
      3.	If there is a response, leave the patient in the position you found him and monitor his breathing and response.
      4.	Reassure the patient.
      5.	Manage severe bleedings and other injuries.
      6.	Dial emergency number 112 and ask for help.

      To handle emergency;
      1.	Ensure that the area is safe for you, the bystanders and the patient
      2.	Check for response from the patient; ask for a name or squeeze shoulders of the patient
      3.	If there is no response, make the patient comfortable and monitor his breathing and response. Also manage severe bleedings and other injuries. 
      4.	Dial emergency number (112) and ask for help.
      5.	If the patient is an adult or child above 1 year old, open the patient’s mouth and check for foreign material. If there is foreign material, gently roll the patient to their side and clear the airway. If there is no foreign material, leave the patient on the ground in the position found and open the airway by tilting the head back with a chin lift.
      6.	If the patient is under 1 year old lay the infant on a firm surface and clear their mouth of the blockage with your little finger.
      7.	Check if the patient is breathing normally. If so, place in recovery position and ensure that an ambulance has been called. 
      8.	Continue to check the patient for normal breathing until medical aid arrives.
      9.	If the patient stops breathing, roll them onto their back and start CPR.
      10. Start CPR of 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. Continue CPR until help arrives or the patient starts breathing or you are physically unable to continue.
      11. If, during CPR, the patient starts breathing but is still unconscious, turn them back into the recovery position. Continue to check the patient. Be ready to turn the patient onto their back again and restart CPR if breathing stops.

  utter_recovery_position:
  - text: |
      To put the patient in recovery position;
      1.	Kneel beside the casualty. Remove the patient’s glasses and any bulky objects, such as mobile phones or large bunches of keys, from their pockets. Do not search pockets for small items.
      2.	Make sure that both of the casualty’s legs are straight. Place the arm that is closest to you at right angles to the casualty’s body, with the elbow bent and the palm facing upward.
      3.	Bring the arm that is farthest from you across the casualty’s chest, and hold the back of the hand against the cheek closest to you. With your other hand, grasp the far leg just above their knee and pull it up, keeping the foot flat on the ground.
      4.	Keeping the casualty’s hand pressed against their cheek, pull on the far leg and roll the casualty toward you and onto their side.
      5.	If the patient is an infant under 1 year old, lie the infant face down on your forearm and support the infant’s head with your hand.

      To put the patient in recovery position;
      1.	If you suspect a spinal injury and need to place the casualty in the recovery position, try to keep the spine straight. If you are alone, use the technique shown in recovery position.
      2.	If you have a helper, one of you should steady the head while the other turns the casualty (right).
      3.	With three people, one person should steady the head while another turns the casualty. The third person should keep the casualty’s back straight during the maneuver.

      To perform CPR;
      1.	Ensure that the patient is on a firm surface. Place the patient on their back and kneel beside the patient’s chest. Locate the lower half of the breastbone in the center of the chest.
      2.	Place the heel of one hand on the lower half of the breastbone and the heel of the other hand on top of the first hand. Interlock the fingers of your hands and raise your fingers.
      3.	Position yourself vertically above the patient’s chest. Ensure that your arms are straight then press down on the patient’s chest until it is compressed by about one-third.
      4.	Release the pressure. Pressing down and releasing is 1 compression. Give 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths. Compressions should be done at a rate of two compressions per second. 
      5.	At least 5 sets of 30 compressions and 2 breaths should be achieved in two minutes and interruptions should be minimized as much as possible.
      6.	CPR should be continued until the patient starts breathing normally, you are physically unable to continue, more qualified help arrives and takes over or a healthcare professional directs that CPR be ceased.
      7.	Keep in mind that any attempt at resuscitation is better than no attempt at all. Giving only compressions is better than nothing at all.

      To perform CPR;
      1.	Open the child's airway by placing one hand on the child’s forehead and gently tilting their head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose.
      2.	Pinch their nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths
      3.	Place the heel of one hand on the centre of their chest and push down by 5cm (about two inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use two hands if you can't achieve a depth of 5cm using one hand
      4.	After every 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two breaths
      5.	Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives

      3.	Place two fingers in the middle of the chest and push down by 4cm (about 1.5 inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use the heel of one hand if you can't achieve a depth of 4cm using the tips of two fingers.
      4.	After 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two rescue breaths.
      5.	Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrive.
  utter_give_breaths:

      1.	Open the airway using the head tilt and chin lift and then place one hand on the patient’s forehead or top of their head. Use the other hand on the chin to tilt their head (not the neck) backwards.  Be sure to avoid pressure on the neck and soft tissue under the skin.
      2.	With the head tilted backwards, pinch the soft part of the nose closed with your index finger and thumb, or  seal the nose with your cheek.
      3.	Open the patient’s mouth by placing your thumb over the chin below the lip and supporting the tip of jaw with the knuckle of middle finger. Place your index finger along jaw line. The chin is held up by your thumb and fingers in order to open the mouth and keep the airway clear.
      4.	Take a breath and place your lips over the patient’s mouth, ensuring a good seal. Blow steadily for about 1 second, watching for the chest to rise. Turn your mouth away from the patient’s mouth and watch for chest to fall, and listen and feel for signs of air being expelled. Maintain head tilt and chin lift. Take another breath and repeat the sequence which is now 2 breaths.
      5.	If the chest does not rise, recheck the mouth and remove any obstructions. Make sure the head is tilted and chin lifted, and ensure there is a good seal around the mouth and nose.
  utter_manage_injured:
  - text: |-
      There are three aspects to this:
      1.	First, find out what is wrong with the casualty
      2.	Second, treat conditions found in order of severity—life-threatening conditions first
      3.	Third, arrange for the next step of a casualty’s care. You will need to decide what type of care a casualty needs. You may need to call for emergency help, suggest the casualty seeks medical advice, or allow him to go home, accompanied if you think it is necessary.
      4.	Other people at the incident can help you with this. Ask one of them to call 911 for emergency help while you attend a casualty. Alternatively, they may be able to look after less seriously injured casualties, or retrieve first aid equipment.
  utter_head_to_toe_examination:
  - text: |-
      1.	Assess breathing. Check the rate (fast or slow), depth (shallow or deep), and nature (is it easy or difficult, noisy or quiet). Check the pulse. Assess the rate (fast or slow), rhythm (regular or irregular) and strength (strong or weak).
      2.	Start the physical examination at the casualty's head. Run your hands carefully over the scalp to feel for bleeding, swelling, or depression, which may indicate a fracture. Be careful not to move the casualty if you suspect that she may have injured her neck.
      3.	Speak clearly to the casualty in both ears to find out if she responds or if she can hear. Look for clear fluid or watery blood coming from either ear. These discharges may be signs of a serious head injury.
      4.	Examine both eyes. Note whether they are open. Check the size of the pupils (the black area). If the pupils are not the same size it may indicate head injury. Look for any foreign object, or blood in the whites of the eyes.
      5.	Check the nose for discharges as you did for the ears. Look for clear fluid or watery blood (or a mixture of both) coming from either nostril. Soot around the nostrils or singed nasal hairs might indicate serious airway burns.
      6.	Look in the mouth for anything that might obstruct the airway. If the casualty has dentures that are intact and fit firmly, leave them. Look for mouth wounds or burns and check for irregularity in the line of the teeth.
      7.	Look at the skin. Note the colour and temperature: is it pale, flushed, or gray-blue (cyanosis); is it hot or cold, dry or damp? Pale, cold, sweaty (clammy) skin suggests shock; a flushed, hot face suggests fever or heatstroke. A blue tinge indicates lack of oxygen; look for this in the lips, ears, and face.
      8.	Loosen clothing around the neck, and look for signs such as a medical warning necklace or a hole (stoma) in the windpipe. Run your fingers gently along the spine from the base of the skull down as far as possible without moving the casualty; check for irregularity, swelling, tenderness, or deformity.
      9.	Look at the chest. Ask the casualty to breathe deeply, and note whether the chest expands evenly, easily, and equally on both sides. Feel the rib cage to check for deformity, irregularity, or tenderness. Ask the casualty if she is aware of grating sensations when breathing, and listen for unusual sounds. Note whether breathing causes any pain. Look for any external injuries, such as bleeding or stab wounds.
      10. Feel along the collarbones, shoulders, upper arms, elbows, hands, and fingers for any swelling, tenderness, or deformity. Check the movements of the elbows, wrists, and fingers by asking the casualty to bend and straighten each joint.
      11. Check that the casualty has no abnormal sensations in the arms or fingers. If the fingertips are pale or gray-blue there may be a problem with blood circulation. Look out for needle marks on the forearms, or a medical warning bracelet.
      12. If there is any impairment in movement or loss of sensation in the limbs, do not move the casualty to examine the spine, since these signs suggest spinal injury. Otherwise, gently pass your hand under the hollow of the back and check for swelling and tenderness.
      13. Gently feel the casualty’s abdomen to detect any evidence of bleeding, and to identify any rigidity or tenderness of the abdomen’s muscular wall, which could be a sign of internal bleeding. Compare one side of the abdomen with the other. Note any bruising on the abdomen or pelvis.
      14. Feel both sides of the hips, and examine the pelvis for signs of fracture. Check clothing for any evidence of incontinence, which suggests spinal or bladder injury, or bleeding from orifices, which suggests pelvic fracture.
      15. Check the legs. Look and feel for bleeding, swelling, deformity, or tenderness. Ask the casualty to raise each leg in turn, and to move her ankles and knees.
      16. Check the movement and feeling in the toes. Check that the victim has no abnormal sensations in her feet or toes. Compare the feet. Look at the skin colour: gray-blue skin may indicate a circulatory disorder or an injury due to cold.
  utter_pulse_check:
  - text: |-
      1.	The pulse may be felt at the wrist (radial pulse), or if this is not possible, the neck (carotid pulse).
      2.	For radial pulse, Place the pads of two or three fingers below the wrist creases at the base of the thumb.
      3.	For carotid pulse, Place the pads of two fingers in the hollow between the large neck muscle and the windpipe.
      4.	In babies, the pulse in the upper arm (brachial pulse) is easier to find. Place the pads of two fingers on the inner side of an infant’s upper arm.
      5.	When checking a pulse, use your fingers (not your thumb) and press lightly against the skin. Record the following points; Rate (number of beats per minute), Strength (strong or weak), Rhythm (regular or irregular).

  utter_mild_choking:
  - text: |-
      If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves.
      If choking is mild:1.	Encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage2.	Ask them to try to spit out the object if it’s in their mouth3.	Don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you
      4.	If coughing doesn’t work, start back blows and call 112 for an ambulance.
       5.	Bend the patient forward and give up to 5 sharp blows on the back between the shoulder blades with the heel of one hand. Check if the blockage has been removed after each blow.
      6.	If the blockage has not cleared after 5 back blows, give up to 5 chest thrusts by placing one hand in the middle of the patient’s back for support and the heel of the other on the lower half of the sternum. Thrusts should be slower and sharper than CPR compressions. Check if the blockage has been removed after each thrust.
      7.	If the blockage has not cleared after 5 thrusts, continue alternating 5 back blows with 5 chest thrusts until medical aid arrives.
      8.	If the patient becomes unconscious, start following the steps for handling emergency before the ambulance arrives.

 utter_severe_choking:
  - text: |-
      If choking is severe, the person won’t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they’ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old:
      1.	Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.
      2.	Give up to five sharp blows between the person’s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist).
      3.	Check if the blockage has cleared.
      4.	If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts.
      5.	Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people.
      To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn’t in one of the above groups:
      6.	Stand behind the person who is choking.
      7.	Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward.
      8.	Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button.
      9. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards.
      10. Repeat this up to five times.
      11. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five.
      12. If the obstruction doesn't clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives.
      13. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain.
